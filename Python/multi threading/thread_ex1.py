# Question 1
# Write a program whose job is to calculate in parallel the series
# of prime numbers between 1 and m. The program will get as parameters
# two positive integers m and n. m represents the number up to it you
# must find the prime numbers, and n is the number of threads that can
# be run simultaneously. The program will check all the numbers in the
# range of 1â€¦m and print the prime numbers in order.
# The numbers will be checked as follows:
# Each thread will refer to a database of numbers to get one
# to be checked. The threads will simultaneously check the number
# they received and at the end they will contact the database to
# update the answer. The thread will repeat the operations as long
# as there are numbers in the database to check. The thread will end
# when there are no more numbers in the database.
# Instruction:
# The program includes the following elements:
# - A database of numbers responsible for the division of labor and the preservation of results.
# - n threads.
# - You must make sure that all the processes finish their job before printing the results.
# - The program must check the correctness of the parameters.
# Use the program you wrote to print the prime numbers from
# 1 to 1000, using ten processes that test in parallel
